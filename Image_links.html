<p>The Huracán EVO is the evolution of the most successful V10-powered Lamborghini ever. The result of fine-tuning and refining existing features, combined with new design solutions that increase performance, the car stands out for its ability to anticipate and cater to the driver’s behavior, expectations and desires.

The Huracán EVO introduces refined aerodynamic solutions while remaining true to the design philosophy that is the hallmark of Lamborghini. 
The front bumper adopts unmistakable Lamborghini Y-shape stylistic elements, hood lines inspired by the Countach, skirt air intakes reminiscent of the Murciélago, and central high-mounted exhaust tailpipes that recall the highest-performance Lamborghini models of the past.

The passenger compartment features a cutting-edge 8.4-inch touchscreen system in the center console, from which the vehicle and entertainment functions are controlled. Exclusive interior finishes reflect authentic Italian design and feature the highest quality materials, with upholstery available in leather, Alcantara and—for the first time—Carbon Skin®, an innovative carbon-fiber material available exclusively from Lamborghini.</p>
